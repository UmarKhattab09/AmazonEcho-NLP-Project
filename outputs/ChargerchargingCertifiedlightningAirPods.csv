It 100% works! Before i had quite a short iphone lightning cable in which gave me uncomfortable positions when charging and going on it. This makes it easier to roam around! I would say the charging ability is the same as it does charge the same pace. The build quality is the same as any other cable. I love this 10 meter size cable and they even include the adapter!

This is the longest cord and I love it. I can take about 7 steps from my bedroom to the hallway and still have a little space without pulling in my charger cord. Price, quality, cord length unbeatable.

These lightning chargers are great. They charge very fast and I have not had any trouble out of the durability of the cords (they are used everyday).  The price is great, making them a great value. These work on the iPhone 14 and older phones (NOT the 15 & 16s).  I definitely would recommend.

Perfect Apple Charger Combo ‚Äì Fast, Reliable, and Long Cables!After weeks of searching for a reliable, high-quality charger set for my iPhone and AirPods, I finally decided on this [Apple MFi Certified] 2 Pack Apple Type C Wall Charger Block with 2 Pack [6FT & 10FT] Long USB-C to Lightning Cables. I can confidently say this is one of the best Apple charger combos I‚Äôve ever used, and here‚Äôs why:Blazing Fast ChargingRight out of the box, I noticed a major improvement in charging speed. The USB-C wall adapter delivers fast charging that‚Äôs noticeably quicker than my older standard USB charger. I was able to get my iPhone 14 from 20% to over 80% in about 30 minutes, which is a huge convenience when I'm on the go or need a quick charge before heading out.Certified for Safety and CompatibilityOne of the key selling points for me was the Apple MFi certification. I‚Äôve had bad experiences in the past with off-brand chargers that either stopped working after a few weeks or gave me the dreaded ‚Äúaccessory not supported‚Äù warning. With this set, I‚Äôve had zero issues. It works flawlessly with my iPhone 14, my partner‚Äôs iPhone 12 Pro Max, and even my AirPods Pro. That peace of mind is priceless.Two Chargers + Two Long Cables = Incredible ValueThis set comes with two charger blocks and two cables ‚Äì one 6 feet and one 10 feet. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd appreciate the length as much as I do, but I absolutely love it. The 6-foot cable is perfect for bedside charging, while the 10-foot cable reaches comfortably across the living room or hotel room when traveling. No more sitting awkwardly close to the outlet!Durable and Well-MadeThe cables are surprisingly sturdy ‚Äì much better than the flimsy cords that come with most phones. They have a strong, reinforced connection point at the plug, and they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôll fray or break with normal use. I‚Äôve been using them daily for a few weeks now, and they still look and perform like new.Overall ImpressionIf you‚Äôre looking for a reliable, fast-charging, and safe solution for your Apple devices, this combo is a no-brainer. You get two complete charger sets, long and flexible cable options, and the confidence of Apple certification ‚Äî all at a very reasonable price. Whether you're upgrading from older gear or just need extras for the office, car, or travel, this charger set delivers everything you need.Highly recommended ‚Äî I‚Äôd absolutely purchase again and already plan to get a set as a gift!
